# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in Java
This is an interactive Java-based implementation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, where the user competes against the computer in real time. Built during a semester break as a self-motivated project, the game uses the Scanner class to capture user input and the Random class to generate computer choices, simulating a playful match-up.

The program emphasizes:
- Basic control flow and conditional logic
- User input handling
- Random number generation to simulate unpredictability
- Clean, readable code for easy understanding and maintenance
  
Besides being an engaging way to strengthen programming fundamentals, this project reflects creativity, attention to detail, and enthusiasm for hands-on coding
